    - check that simulation stops beyong the last available point
    - Change IRF zones in zenith (Gernot recommendations)
    - Add subsequent days
    - Check coherence of the alt-az computation with the flux -> the same     
    - Stack the prompt with the afterglow
    
    - Can we suppress simulation for large S and B
    - Can we protect output files that are being written ?

    - use logging for warning and debug messages ?
    - use pytable to write out the result () ?

    - Extrapolate Fermi GRBs to CTA, compute response
	- Inject Fermi data and IRF, compute response
    - Compute the fluence ? 
    - Interpolate time counts within the time slices;

    - create test units and run them (e.g. a dummy simplistic GRB)
    - make a how-to run SoHAPPy for production
    - check new production version can run without matplotlib
