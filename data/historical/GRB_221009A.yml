# FERMI LAT
# Using LAT events with E>100 MeV between T0+200 s and T0+800 s,
# we find a LAT localization of

# RA = 288.282, Dec = 19.495,

# with a 90% containment radius of 0.027 degrees (statistical only).

# The LAT lightcurve shows a bright structured emission episode
# which is temporally coincident with the GBM main emission episode
# starting at T0+200s.
# The 100 MeV - 1 GeV photon flux in the time interval 200-800 s after
# the GBM trigger is (6.2 +/- 0.4)E-03 ph/cm2/s.
# The estimated photon index above 100 MeV is -1.87 +/- 0.04.

 # From a preliminary analysis, the LAT emission
# is extending for about 25ks post GBM trigger.
# The highest-energy photon is 99.3 GeV (with a probability of 99.2%)
# which is observed 240 seconds after the GBM trigger.
# This represents the highest GRB photon energy
# ever detected by Fermi-LAT (the previous record holder being
# a 95 GeV event from GRB 130427A).
