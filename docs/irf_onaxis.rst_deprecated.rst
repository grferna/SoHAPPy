On-axis files
-------------

SoHAPPy has been originally build to use the so called On-Axis IRF. This files
are extracted from the more general "Full enclosure off-axis" files (see below).
They consist in the IRF selected on-axis (center of the field of view) and
an agular extension corresponding to the energy dependednt 68% PSF containment.
They have been produced for both CTA-Mars and Evnt-Display analysis. In this
latter it corresponds to the official CTA performace curves (that are obtained
with Event-Display that indeed use a 68% containment whereas the MARS analysis
has an optimised containment cut).
At the date to the SoHAPPy development the following configuration were
available:
